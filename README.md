# Go Project Structure Generator

## About

This document describes a script that creates a standardized directory structure and initial files for a Go project.

## Usage

Run the script with a project name as an argument:

```bash
./script_name.sh <project-name>
```
## For example:
```bash
./script_name.sh my-awesome-project
```
## File Contents

- main.go: Contains the entry point of the application, sets up environment variables, and starts the HTTP server.
- routes.go: Defines the routing for the application.
- handler.go: Contains HTTP request handlers.
- model.go: Defines data models.
- utils.go: Contains utility functions.
- config.go: Manages application configuration.
- go.mod: Defines the module and its dependencies.
- Makefile: Provides common commands for building, testing, and running the application.

## Makefile Commands

- make build: Builds the application.
- make test: Runs the tests.
- make run: Builds and runs the application.
- make clean: Removes the built binary.

## Customization
You can modify the script to add or remove directories and files as needed for your project structure. The content of the generated files can also be customized by editing the relevant sections in the script.
## Requirements

- Bash shell

## Note
This script assumes a GitHub repository under the username "yourusername". Make sure to update this in the go.mod file and main.go if your username or repository location is different.
